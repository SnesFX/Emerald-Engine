# Emerald-Engine


* A heavy work in progress 2D Classic Sonic Engine in Unity.

* Originally only for 3DS devices but I wanted to extend it to other platforms.

# FAQ

* Q: When will it be done?
* A: Whenever lmao

* Q: What's the difference between this and other Sonic Engines?
* A: I guess nothing besides the multiple platform thingy.

* Q: Will there be hyper and super forms?
* A: Yes, along with Dark forms.

# Warning or something lmfao

* This is still a heavy w.i.p. like 99.9% of the shit doesn't even work yet lmao, so like don't get mad at me when you download this and expect it to be a full   fledged engine that works and functions.
